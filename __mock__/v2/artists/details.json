        "artistBio": "One thing you have to remember about The Beatles is that there was no Beatles before The Beatles. No model for a white band that credibly mixed early rock with real R&B. No model for performers who wrote their own material instead of vocalizing others’. No model for a band that could be both popular and truly progressive, whose new releases weren’t just products but evolutionary leaps in what the form was capable of. Before The Beatles, you had pop music and you had art; after The Beatles, the idea that you could get both in a single three-minute shot—a mirror of a similar shift in painting and visual art—became commonplace, even expected. If “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and “Please Please Me” made the competition look quaint, “Strawberry Fields Forever” and “Tomorrow Never Knows” made it look obsolete, stone bowls in an era of cupped hands. They were around for 10 years, and the culture has been reeling ever since.<br> \nFormed in Liverpool, England, in 1960, the band—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr (the replacement for Pete Best)—didn’t have big plans at first. In 1962, they were still ducking beer bottles at late-night shows in Hamburg; six months later, “Beatlemania“ was a safety concern. How the band found time to grow is hard to fathom: Listen back to that opening chord on “A Hard Day’s Night” or the proto-psychedelic vibe of “Ticket to Ride,” and you can already hear them pushing against the confines of pop’s sound and form.<br>\nBy the mid-’60s, they’d become ambassadors for the counterculture, tackling subjects—drugs, Eastern spirituality, the limits of consciousness—nobody had bothered thinking about in the mainstream before. In the hands of producer George Martin, they also became one of the first bands to use the studio as an instrument, creating works whose density and complexity (revisit anything from 1966’s <I>Revolver</i> to 1968’s “The White Album”) couldn’t be replicated onstage—innovations that, incidentally, coincided with the band’s retirement from touring.<br>\nLate Beatles albums—<I>Abbey Road</I> and the “posthumous” <I>Let It Be</I>—were lived-in, almost folksy affairs, the loose victory laps of a band with nothing left to prove. Given the pressure and intensity that surrounded them, it’s almost amazing they lasted as long as they did. They played their final show on the rooftop of the building for their multimedia company, Apple Corps, in January 1969, ending with Lennon’s famous parting words: “I’d like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we’ve passed the audition.”"

                  "standard": "“<i>Abbey Road</i> as a whole, as an album, is a very good gateway to the rest of the Beatles universe,” producer Giles Martin tells Apple Music. “Because it's the most contemporary-sounding album. It doesn't sound like it was recorded in the '60s.” What the album does sound like—and how it got to sound that way—is of particular interest to Martin, whose late father George was the Fab Four's original producer. And as he did with the 50th anniversary reissues of <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> in 2017 and the White Album in 2018, Martin has painstakingly rebuilt The Beatles' 11th and penultimate album piece by piece, and also unearthed a trove of demos and alternate tracks. (A highlight of the latter includes the band bantering about noise complaints from Abbey Road neighbors while recording “I Want You [She's So Heavy]”.)<br />\nThe goal of the project is not just to appeal to Beatles obsessives, but also to recontextualize what the album means for a contemporary audience and to upgrade the sonic fidelity to match what they are used to hearing. “One of the things we strive for in doing these mixes is so that when people listen to, say, Apple Music, you can have a playlist or a radio station with The Beatles next to Ed Sheeran. I'm interested in seeing if you can switch someone from hearing to listening; audiophiles listen to mixes and people listen to songs. I would love younger generations, or new listeners, or people who weren't aware, to go back and listen to The Beatles. They are the bedrock of popular music for so many people.” To help wade through the embarrassment of riches, Martin highlights a handful of tracks that best show The Beatles in this last unified moment before fracturing, and that are most revelatory in newly remixed form.<br />\n<b>Come Together</b>\n“One of the toughest songs to mix. The reason why is because it's so simple—there's not much on it. It's the band playing live, and it's one of their greatest performances. It's the one track that Ringo and Paul said to me, 'We were really good on this day.' It shows a sophistication as far as playing goes, how far The Beatles have come—they're basically taking what was originally a blues song and completely standing it on its head. The first thing we normally do when we remix Beatles stuff is we put the drums in the center. With 'Come Together,' we did that, and then it just didn't sound as good. So we actually took each individual drum hit and we panned the drums. They move from right to left, or right to center. On the original, they just stand in place.”<br />\n<b>Here Comes the Sun</b> \n“The biggest streaming Beatles song, the one that's the most listened to. It has a slightly more contemporary feel; it's acoustic. The one thing that the new mix of <i>Abbey Road</i> shows off is how good their backing vocals were.”<br />\n<b>I Want You (She’s So Heavy) [Trident Recording Session & Reduction Mix]</b>\n“There's so much written about how these records are created and what microphones they used and what my father's role was and what trousers people were wearing, et cetera. What excites me is when you hear someone talking and just being a guy in a studio making a piece of music that will last 50 years and beyond. What makes it great is the empathy that they have for the outside world: 'Okay, we'll do one more loud one and then we'll do one more'—and that was John Lennon, the angriest Beatle. That's why I do love the beauty of this: Great records are made by humans. They're not made by machine. The thing I look for in the demos is humanity—the creation and the sparks you hear that made the records you love.”<br />\n<b>Something (Studio Demo)</b>\n“Some demos are kind of strange. The thing about George is that there was a fragility to what he did. My dad would say that he never gave George enough time. He deserved more attention, and there is no doubt that George thought he deserved more attention as well. But George was considered a tapestry maker. He'd be in the corner with a needle and thread, working away on his music, and be very precise about things. And you get that from some demos.”<br />\n<b>The End</b>\n“The original is in mono—what we do is play the orchestra back in the studio and create a stereo sound piece. The guitar solos at the end are obviously Paul, John, and George, all playing on one track. We now separate them so you have them left-center-right, and that's probably how they were standing when they recorded them in the studio. Again, that's what I get back to: What we're trying to do is get closer to the performance. When anyone listens to <i>Abbey Road</i>, they should realize that they did play it live. They loved each other, and people can hear that now.”",

The sheer breadth of material as well as the mixture of the loud and the soft is part of what makes \"The White Album\" so surprising. The heavy sounds of \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Yer Blues\" juxtapose with the gentle beauty of \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Julia.\" The cacophony of \"Revolution 9\" is followed by the orchestral lullaby of \"Good Night.\" The album's extended length gave the band room in which they could explore all of their musical influences and multiple forms of popular music, while creating revolutionary sounds in the studio.",

                  "standard": "Though wedged between the comparatively giant <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> and 1968’s White Album, <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> nevertheless played a part in The Beatles' story, and put a cap on a year in which the band made yet more music nobody was totally prepared for them to make. The album was released as a companion to a meandering, band-directed movie, and its first half is probably one of the lowest-stakes sides in the band’s catalog—a relief, in a way, from how high-stakes their music had become. Still, this was The Beatles in 1967—momentum was strong. What had started out as a string of acid playground rhymes turned into Lennon’s angriest song this side of 1970 (“I Am the Walrus”), while McCartney’s simple sentimentality had taken on a quality that felt stoic, almost abstract (“The Fool on the Hill”). There was a rare instrumental (“Flying”), a foggy Harrison drone (“Blue Jay Way”), and an invocation of the past by McCartney that blurred lines between sweet and eerie (“Your Mother Should Know”).<br />\nWhile the band had helped rechristen the album format as an artistic statement unto itself, they were still releasing singles—as in tracks that weren’t associated with any album. Designed primarily as a consumer service, the second half of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> collected what they’d offered in 1967. The yin-yang of McCartney’s “Penny Lane” and Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever” (originally released on the same 7-inch record) arguably says more about what ground the band covered in seven minutes than any other two songs in their catalog—the former baroque, charming, and upbeat; the latter dense and melancholy—variations on a theme of seemingly simple pasts refracted, dreamlike, through the present. And if “I Am the Walrus” was Lennon’s dark foray into contradiction and surreality, McCartney’s “Hello, Goodbye” was its bright counterpart. “Baby, You’re a Rich Man” probably doesn’t get the credit it deserves. “All You Need Is Love,” debuted to an estimated 400 million people in the world’s first live international satellite TV production (<i>Our World</i>), did receive wide acclaim, and while cynicism and embarrassment about 1967’s Summer of Love would set in as soon as a few years later, it probably deserves more.<br />\nAs for the movie that gave the album its name, press coverage of it was so uniformly hostile (not to mention viewer feedback to the BBC switchboard so sustained) that McCartney went on the BBC the day after it first aired to defuse the tension. Asked why he thought people didn’t like it, McCartney said he wasn’t sure—he liked it fine.",

                  "standard": "For better and worse, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> helped set the precedent that rock bands could (and should) do more or less whatever they wanted. Songs got longer, albums grew concepts, and the idea of the LP as a concise product meant to showcase a performer’s talents gave way to the suspicion that commercial concerns ultimately only served The Man. A few months before The Beatles were set to record <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>, Bob Dylan had released <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>, an album so expansive it had to literally be pressed onto two records, while The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i> stretched the dimensions and possibilities of the three-minute pop song. McCartney in particular had been fascinated by things like Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention’s 1966 debut, <i>Freak Out!</i>, a double album whose hodgepodge of songs, noise, skits, and sound gags mirrored conceptual art’s breaking of the painterly frame. Where The Beatles had once sought to distill and consolidate, now they were looking to expand. McCartney had even come up with an alter ego and pseudo-unifying backstory—a move Lennon later said only worked because the band <i>said</i> it worked. In other words, they didn’t want to just exorcise the group that made “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” they wanted to smother them with a pillow. Vacationing in France just before recording had started, McCartney slicked his hair back with Vaseline and wandered the streets in a fake mustache and clear-lens glasses, an experience he called “quite liberating.”<br />\nFor all its experiments (“A Day in the Life”) and invocations of the counterculture (“Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds”), it’s probably the band’s most conservative album: the beer hall sing-alongs of the title track and “With a Little Help From My Friends,” the old-timey entertainments of “Being for the Benefit of Mister Kite!,” the domestic contentment of “When I’m Sixty-Four.” Like The Kinks circa “Waterloo Sunset” and <i>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</i> and The Beach Boys of <i>Smiley Smile</i>, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> is an album that looked toward the past instead of the future, the work of guys in their late twenties starting to wonder if they’d been too eager to break from the old world—or at least might have lost something along the way. (Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever,” recorded around the same time, covered similar themes; that the band was all taking acid—a drug that has a way of flattening geologic time—probably didn’t hurt either.) Even Lennon’s lyric on “A Day in the Life”—“I read the news today, oh boy”—rang with a cosmic quaintness, an image not of young radicals on the loose but of the aging souls of “Eleanor Rigby,” finding infinite richness in a narrow life. A couple of months after the album was released, the band—along with partners, children, and business infrastructure—traveled to Greece with the vague intention of buying an island for everyone to live on, but eventually managed to think better of it.",

                  "standard": "One of the great, possibly true stories about 1966’s <i>Revolver</i> concerns an exchange between Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan at London’s Mayfair Hotel about what they were currently working on. (In Dylan’s case, it was <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>.) On hearing the tape loops and death poetry of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” Dylan allegedly said to McCartney, “Oh, I get it. You don’t want to be cute anymore.” \n\nIt’s not entirely true. Part of what makes <i>Revolver</i> appealing is that it’s as much “Yellow Submarine” and the domestic sweetness of “Here, There and Everywhere” as it is “She Said She Said” and “Tomorrow Never Knows.” But Dylan’s point was well-taken: For a band that put out “I Want to Hold Your Hand” less than three years earlier, the relative complexity of <i>Revolver</i>—in both sound and subject matter—not only challenged The Beatles’ image as the pop band the whole family could agree on (as opposed to, say, The Rolling Stones), but it also put pop on a course toward unfamiliar horizons.\n\nNot only were The Beatles able to bridge their interest in the relatively uncommercial worlds of psychedelia, experimental, and Indian classical music with Motown (“Got to Get You Into My Life”) and what we now think of as classically Beatlesque pop (“Good Day Sunshine”), but they also gave us a template for the pop album as the kaleidoscopically varied studio construction we think of it as today. Cute, but more. \n\nOn the occasion of the album’s 2022 Super Deluxe reissue—which, in addition to a new mix in Spatial Audio by Giles Martin and Sam Okell, features some extraordinary rehearsals, outtakes, and demos—we’re taking a look back at what shaped <i>Revolver</i> and what <i>Revolver</i> shaped in turn.\n\n<b>Before: The R&B Backbeat</b>\n<i>Revolver</i> is the last Beatles album where you can really hear the influence of American soul and R&B. “Taxman” is obvious, as is “Got to Get You Into My Life,” which John called “our Tamla-Motown bit.” But you can also hear it in “And Your Bird Can Sing” and “Love You To,” whose Indian influence is anchored by a beat heavy enough to drive a dance floor regardless of the continent it’s on. And where the beat of “Tomorrow Never Knows” is rightly cited as a precursor to techno and drum ’n’ bass, it’s also a take on the syncopations of James Brown drummer Clyde Stubblefield, who said he got his style, in part, from listening to washing machines and trains—the funk of daily life. Their growing conceptual interests didn’t get in the way of their roots as a bar-and-dance band, and their ability to bridge the two—or, more importantly, to dissolve the distinction between them—is part of what makes <i>Revolver</i> <i>Revolver</i>. Four people, one room.\n\n<b>Before: British Humor and the Surrealism of Daily Life</b>\nFor however mystical <i>Revolver</i> can seem, squint and you hear an album mostly about ordinary life. “Eleanor Rigby,” “Doctor Robert,” the “Taxman,” the lovebirds of “Here, There and Everywhere,” and the eccentric of “I’m Only Sleeping”: these are the people in your neighborhood, and if they’re stranger than you remember, it might be because you never really looked. The Kinks were experts in this field. And John, in particular, was a fan of the Scottish singer Ivor Cutler, whose novelty songs masked a sense of surrealism that pointed toward more cosmic realms. The point isn’t just that <i>Revolver</i> was strange, but that it located its strangeness in places easily dismissed as familiar. So, while John borrowed the first line of “Tomorrow Never Knows” from a book connecting LSD with <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, its title came from a more historically modest source: Ringo Starr.\n\n<b>Before: Power of the Experiment</b>\nGiven their cultural stature, it’s easy to forget that The Beatles didn’t really know what they were doing at the time. So, while <i>Revolver</i>’s experimental qualities—the tape loops of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” the dislocated horn sections of “Got to Get You Into My Life”—could seem pretentious or alienating, they’re better understood as an embrace of the same unknowns that led to “Yesterday” or “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).” Namely, can this be done? Though the band’s interest in avant-garde composers like John Cage or Luciano Berio wasn’t always obvious in their sound, it spoke to a sense of experimentation and open-mindedness that spurred them on when they could’ve easily and comfortably stayed in the same place.\n\n<b>Before: Pop as Art</b>\nPart of The Beatles’ story is that of pop’s transformation into something like art. Not that <i>Revolver</i> was without precedent. Frank Sinatra’s serial-like string of albums in the ’50s (<i>In the Wee Small Hours</i>, <i>Only the Lonely</i>, <i>No One Cares</i>), Ray Charles’ <i>Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music</i>, the sound sculptures of producers like Phil Spector and Joe Meek, the arrangements of The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i>—all undoubtedly pop music. But they’re also examples of artists stretching pop to accommodate a sense of depth and conceptual ambition that hadn’t been there before. As George said around the time of <i>Revolver</i>’s release, selling a lot of records was nice. Now the point was to make them better.\n\n<b>After: Psychedelia for the Mainstream</b>\nThe real psychedelic quality of <i>Revolver</i> wasn’t its sound but its subject. Time, memory, the inevitability of death: With the exception of Bob Dylan and The Byrds, no mid-’60s pop artists were wading as deeply into inner space as The Beatles. And because, in George’s words, they’d “had a few hits,” their ideas landed on audiences that probably wouldn’t have encountered them otherwise, or at least ones that might’ve been more hesitant to hear them out. The effect was to expand our sense of the terrain that pop music could cover and introduce a sense of headiness and ambiguity that gave way to everything from Jimi Hendrix and Prince to the inward-facing stance of alternative rock. <i>Revolver</i> tried to touch what can’t be touched.\n\n<b>After: The Studio as Instrument</b>\nBefore <i>Revolver</i>, the studio was, by and large, a place where bands went to record music they’d already worked out. After <i>Revolver</i>, it became a kind of instrument of its own. It wasn’t just the unprecedented amount of time The Beatles spent making it (220 hours to <i>Rubber Soul</i>’s 80) or their experiments with new technology; it was the way they opened their process to the concept of music being less a set of notes than a sequence of sounds—an attitude that evolved into everything from dub to shoegaze to hip-hop. Paul remembers meeting with producer George Martin before they went into the studio to play him what they’d been writing. When they got to “Tomorrow Never Knows,” Martin was curious but puzzled: there were no chord changes, no verses, no chorus. In other words, it wasn’t a song. The blueprint was in the band’s collective head, but you couldn’t make sense of it until the work was done.\n\n<b>After: Pop as Playground</b>\n<i>Revolver</i> helped define the pop album as a loose, collagelike space where you could get any number of sounds and moods thrown at you. Paul’s sweetness, John’s cynicism, the experimental and the straightforward, Western R&B and Eastern classical—and each of them somehow as much a part of the band’s identity as the others. Not only was the shift an important step toward understanding artists as people who curate and arrange the world rather than creating it out of thin air, but it also gave us a template you can still hear in everything from <i>Thriller</i> to <i>Purple Rain</i>, M.I.A.’s <i>Kala</i>, and Frank Ocean’s <i>Blonde</i>. <i>Revolver</i> wasn’t just a marketing tool; it was an experience. And the band’s eclecticism wasn’t a lack of commitment—it was liberation.\n",

                  "standard": "It wasn’t just that <i>Rubber Soul</i> was sonically groundbreaking (it was), or that Lennon and McCartney’s songwriting had reached new heights of maturity and ambiguity (okay), but that it was the first Beatles album where each song seemed to exist unto itself and yet worked in alchemical harmony with everything around it: the emergence of the pop album as creative kaleidoscope.<br />\nMcCartney had told the <i>New Musical Express</i> that the band was banking on comedy being the next big thing after protest music—a reflection, possibly, of the existential irreverence one feels on acid, their growing insularity from (and reluctance toward) the culture at large, a philosophical commitment to enjoying the ride, or some giddy mix of all three.<br />\nWhatever the case, <i>Rubber Soul</i> is a deeply funny album: the gender play of “Drive My Car” (and the <i>beep-beep</i> backing vocals), the cabaret of “Michelle” (because nothing warms up the object of one’s desire like French), the way Lennon sucks deeply through his teeth before oozing the chorus to “Girl.” Even the album’s most earnest songs (“Nowhere Man,” “In My Life”) were touched by a nursery-rhyme gentleness that made their themes (psychic alienation, the astonishing continuity of past and present) go down easily. As for “Norwegian Wood,” what can you really do with the suggestion that the narrator burns the girl’s house down but shrug in uncertainty? This is how the album unfolds: colorful, dreamy, and delirious on the surface, with shadows swimming underneath.<br />\nThe overall feeling is one of liberation: In getting a little chemical-assisted distance from their egos, the band was able to explore style in ways that felt fluid and radical, changing costumes from song to song instead of locking themselves continuously into being The Beatles—a channel-changing approach that only became more pronounced as their career wound on (especially on the White Album and <i>Abbey Road</i>), not to mention set a new precedent for the diversity of modes and expressions pop artists were suddenly allowed to explore. As for the title, McCartney had remembered something an old bluesman said about Mick Jagger—that he was “plastic soul.” In the original iteration, it was a diss; in The Beatles’ version, it was a statement of liberation: In embracing artifice, you free yourself from the confines of the real.",

                  "standard": "If <i>A Hard Day’s Night</i> and <i>Beatles For Sale</i> sounded like a band chafing at the confines of their own success, <i>Help!</i> was more like a meditation: four people seeking solace from inside a storm they’d never seen gather. Lennon, in particular, was miserable: drinking a lot, numbed out, riding the tail of a crumbling marriage for which he had plenty to atone from a 17-room mansion adjacent to a golf course over which he’d never imagined living—a stretch he later called his “Fat Elvis” period.<br />\nWhere <i>Beatles For Sale</i> had captured the vitality of angry young men, the songs on <i>Help!</i>—Lennon’s “Help!” and “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away,” McCartney’s “Yesterday” and “I’ve Just Seen a Face”—felt naked to the point of abstraction, the heat of the feelings stripped away to reveal something pining, innocent, planted on the ground but strangely displaced: alienation without angst.<br />\nCannabis, which the band had been smoking with heroic regularity, probably didn’t hurt: You had the sense that they were singing not from themselves, but about themselves, even <i>to</i> themselves, pieces on a great existential chessboard observed from a place of melancholic remove. (McCartney said the drug made him feel like he was thinking for the first time; Ringo, recalling the filming of the movie that accompanied this album, said—in charming Ringo fashion—that the crew got used to the fact that the band didn’t get much done after lunch.) Even Ringo’s “Act Naturally”—a lighthearted, Kinks-y country song—seemed tinted by a new, more ruminative frame of mind: The guy in the song is an actor playing himself.<br />\nAnd while you could still hear the sweaty club band lurking underneath (“Dizzy Miss Lizzy,” “Help!”), most of the album tilted toward classical austerity: “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away” was the band’s first fully acoustic arrangement (and featured the eternally un-rock sound of flutes); “Yesterday”—a song that seemed so comforting and eternal that McCartney was reportedly haunted by the feeling that it had somehow, somewhere already been written—had a string quartet (a move suggested to a hesitant McCartney by producer George Martin). Having spent their youth in extroversion, the Beatles were turning inward.<br />\nAbout a week after the album came out, the band played a show to 56,000 screaming people at Shea Stadium, a scenario and scale so unprecedented that Vox had designed special amplifiers for the event. A week or so after that, they took a few much-needed days off at a rented house in Beverly Hills (featuring a moat and a drawbridge), only to be discovered by four teenage female fans. When security guards turned the girls away, they went home, opened the Yellow Pages, and rented a helicopter. <i>Help!</i>—that sounds right.",

                  "standard": "Driving through Colorado during a road trip in early 1964, Bob Dylan heard a rundown of the country’s Top 10 singles, more than half of which were by The Beatles. By then, the band had saturated America with the same bizarre speed they’d saturated England, first broadcast on American radio about a week before Christmas 1963 by a Washington, D.C.-area DJ whose friend—a flight attendant for BOAC—had brought a copy of “I Want to Hold Your Hand” over in their luggage, essentially unplugging the last finger holding back a transatlantic flood.<br />\nWhether or not Dylan liked the band’s music was unclear. (We’re talking about Bob Dylan here.) What he did acknowledge was that their sound—the energy, the harmonic language, the combination of universally appealing but unprecedented—was somehow inevitable; that they pointed the direction of where music <i>had</i> to go.<br />\nAt the time, folk—Dylan’s province—was considered part of a vanguard; in jazz, composers like John Coltrane had already signaled a move toward abstraction; in visual art, pop had happily unseated the macho hugeness of abstract expressionism; independent filmmaking was developing a momentum. In other words, where other cultural avenues had taken new directions, pop music had mostly stayed the course.<br />\nReleased in summer 1964 (only a year and change after <i>Please Please Me</i>), <i>A Hard Day’s Night</i> was arguably the first glimpse of our modern idea of The Beatles: safe but a little strange; warm but with shades of bleakness; a band that experimented tirelessly without ever leaving the mainstream. Famously, it was the first time that Lennon and McCartney had written all of the album’s songs, a gesture that set the precedent for the then-new idea that pop (and, by extension, the musicians who made it) wasn’t just a vehicle for a good show, but art that revealed some otherwise inexpressible part of the artist’s soul—something personal.<br />\nThe music was more evolved too. What had, on their first couple of albums, been borrowed from R&B and soul covers became baked into their own compositions: the workaday relief of the title track, the blues morality of “Can’t Buy Me Love” (covered, almost immediately, by Ella Fitzgerald). Lennon’s “I’ll Be Back” was the moodiest song they’d ever recorded, McCartney’s “And I Love Her” the most nakedly open-hearted, capturing a shadow-and-light quality that was warm but stark—contrasts new not just for their songwriting, but for ’60s pop in general.<br />\nThat the album had originally been conceived of as a soundtrack for a United Artists movie designed to capitalize on The Beatles’ fame in England (Capitol had been famously reticent to release their albums in the United States) is an illustration of just how swiftly the machine’s gears were turning; that the band managed to make not only the album but also the movie as charming and sneakily creative as they did is—well, you see where they got their good reputation.",

                "artistBio": "As Beatlemania raged in the early ’60s, the press dubbed him The Quiet One on account of his dry, diffident media presence—not to mention the fact that his first contribution to the group was a song called “Don’t Bother Me.” But that nickname proved all the more apt as George Harrison became the unassuming catalyst of The Beatles’ radical sonic evolutions over the decade. Born in Liverpool in 1943, Harrison swiftly moved beyond his formative Chuck Berry mimicry to develop the jangly Rickenbacker sound that defined mid-’60s milestones like <i>Help!</i> and <i>Rubber Soul</i> (and spawned a million power-pop bands in their wake). At the same time, his growing fascination with Indian music introduced the sound of the sitar to Western pop audiences, cracking open the portal into The Beatles’ groundbreaking psychedelic explorations (as well as his own pioneering adventures in electronic and tape-loop experimentation on 1968’s <i>Wonderwall Music</i>). But even as he worked in the shadow of the most dominant songwriting partnership in rock history, Harrison’s limited contributions to The Beatles’ canon—be it the wondrous acid raga “Within You, Without You” or the disarmingly vulnerable “While My Guitar Gently Weeps”—provided a profound metaphysical counterpoint to Paul McCartney’s romanticism and John Lennon’s cynicism. He could imbue a simple love song like “Something” with an elegance and eloquence that made it natural cover-tune fodder for Frank Sinatra. Once liberated from his back-seat position in the Fab Four, Harrison channeled all of his widescreen musical ambitions and Zen-master philosophies into his 1970 triple-album masterpiece <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, the most cosmically grandiose statement among all solo Beatle releases. (It was followed by a chart-topping all-star live album—1971’s <i>The Concert for Bangladesh</i>—that effectively presaged the Live Aid era of rock ’n’ roll charity drives.) But Harrison rarely displayed that sort of spotlight-seizing bravado again during a solo career defined by breezy, easygoing sing-alongs, until a Jeff Lynne-abetted comeback—first with 1987’s <i>Cloud Nine</i> and then with the supergroup The Traveling Wilburys—returned him to the Top 10. After surviving a near-fatal home-invasion attack in 1999, Harrison succumbed to cancer in 2001. But in the afterlife, the Quiet Beatle’s spiritual sentiments resound most loudly—his eternally optimistic 1969 serenade “Here Comes the Sun” has become The Beatles’ most popular song in the streaming era."

                "artistBio": "Disregard any hyperbole about John Lennon and The Beatles being the most important thing to ever happen to popular music and ask yourself: How many artists can you name whose work has left people so energized and divided more than 40 years after their death? “She Loves You” and “I Want to Hold Your Hand” most people probably agree on. But what about the agony of “Mother,” or the trio of borderline-amusical experiments he released with Yoko Ono in 1968 and 1969? Lennon revolutionized pop, yes—especially when it came to the scope, depth, and range of subject and feeling we could expect in it. But he also demonstrated that revolution takes risk, and that real risk is, by nature, messy. In an interview a couple of months before he was murdered in 1980, he said that people who were still hung up on the idea that The Beatles had answers in the '80s was like being hung up on swing bands or World War II. The only way to stay ahead of the game was to accept that everything—everything—is unknown.<br> \nHe was born in Liverpool, England, in October 1940. His childhood was unsettled. His teenage skiffle band, The Quarrymen, evolved into The Beatles, where he played the tough, questioning poet to Paul McCartney’s dreamy romantic. His solo songs were skeptical of religion (“God,” “Imagine”) and no more inspired by the politics on Earth (“Instant Karma,” “Working Class Hero”). They could be nasty (“Cold Turkey”), petty (“Whatever Gets You Through the Night”), and at times comically self-interested (“How?”). But they could also summon an innocence so direct and unpretentious it felt less like he was performing than confiding you in (“Love”). And yet even as he drew you into his soft, private world, he projected on a global, rock-star scale. Either he was very different from everyone else, or pretty much the same—only, of course, with the gift and tenacity to express what that means."

                "artistBio": "It wasn’t that rock music didn’t exist before The Rolling Stones—it did. But it didn’t exist at quite the same scale, or with the same reach, or the same sheer attitude that made the Stones so seismic. You wonder if it had something to do with their otherness, as though the fact that the American sounds they emulated—blues, country, R&B—didn't belong to them made them both more reverential and more free to explore. Like excavations from an archaeological dig, the band’s best music played out like a conversation between present and past, finding fresh meaning and connections in sounds that feel classic, bygone. Mick Jagger once said he’d rather be dead than singing “Satisfaction” at 45. Certainly there were other artists of his generation who took the same attitude, figuratively and otherwise. Un-rock as it may be, The Rolling Stones decided to live.<br>\nFormed in 1962 by singer Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards (Richards spotted Jagger carrying Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry records on a train platform), the band—which went on to include jazz drummer Charlie Watts and bassist Ron Wood, among others—became one of the spearheads of the British Invasion, bad boys to The Beatles’ teddy bears. They toyed with folk and psychedelia in the mid-'60s (“Ruby Tuesday,” “Mother’s Little Helper”), but always circled back to something grittier, darker, the “Under My Thumb”s and “Paint It Black”s.<br>\nWith some exceptions (including The Beatles’ famous live farewell at Shea Stadium), the idea of “arena rock” didn’t really exist until the Stones: There wasn’t the infrastructure, the technical capacity. As classic as their late-’60s and ’70s albums are (the country sprawl of <I>Beggars Banquet</I> and <I>Exile on Main St.</I>, the swagger of <I>Some Girls</I>), they made their legacy on stage, scaling up the sweaty rush of small clubs to hockey rinks and football stadiums, using the studio as a place to refine instead of retreat.<br>\nIn commemoration of Mick Jagger’s 75th birthday, a German entomologist persuaded his colleagues to name several fossils after members of the band—a singular tribute, not to mention a loving jab at their longevity. Jagger took his 76th birthday off; the next night, the band was back on tour."

                "artistBio": "As Beatlemania was transforming rock ’n’ roll from passing teen fad to permanent pop-cultural movement, Paul McCartney (born in Liverpool in 1942) became the driving force behind the band’s rapid, dramatic maturation. In just two years, he had graduated from the Little Richard worship of 1963’s “I Saw Her Standing There” to the exquisite orchestral balladry of “Yesterday”—a shift that intensified the contrast between McCartney and his increasingly acerbic songwriting partner, John Lennon. But as The Beatles’ entered their late-’60s experimental phase—during which Lennon’s avant-garde impulses came to the fore—McCartney’s traditionalism constituted its own form of radicalism. Within the band’s psychedelic milieu, his embrace of pre-rock forms, like classical (“Eleanor Rigby”) and English music-hall serenades (“When I’m Sixty-Four”), felt no less surreal than The Beatles' use of tape-loop freak-outs and sitar drones. (And this is to say nothing of Paul's sublime bass playing, which elevated the four-string from rhythmic undercurrent to melodic focal point.) His post-Beatles albums have proven equally uncanny and influential: 1971’s art-folk opus <i>Ram</i> provided the lo-fi schematic for future generations of DIY home-recording artists, while the arena-rattling roar of “Jet,” from McCartney's subsequent band Wings’ 1973 LP <i>Band on the Run</i>, shows why he’s become a muse to hard rockers such as Dave Grohl. And by continually collaborating with the hitmakers of the day—from Michael Jackson in the 1980s to Rihanna and Kanye West in the 2010s—he has remained a voracious pop omnivore, as connected to music's past as its future."

                "artistBio": "For Queen, rock was merely a jumping-off point. Packing enough pomp and grandeur to make their name seem understated, they built high-octane pop songs out of parts boosted from classical music, dance music, doo-wop, New Wave, metal, and opera—forging one of the most distinctive and distinguished catalogs in modern music history. They formed in London, in 1970, after art-school graduate Farrokh Bulsara combined forces with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor of the band Smile—but they didn’t truly become Queen until they were joined by bassist John Deacon and Bulsara changed his name to Freddie Mercury. Their self-titled debut came out in 1973, just as some of prog rock’s most pervasive clichés were starting to solidify, and they wasted no time subverting them. They wrote complex songs but always winked at their own penchant for excess; the combination of Mercury’s mischievousness and the rest of the band’s relative bookishness—May studied astrophysics throughout his life—made them instantly unique. They captured it best on 1975’s audacious <i>A Night at the Opera</i>, which, in addition to being the most expensive album ever made at the time, featured “Bohemian Rhapsody,” a six-minute mini-opera (and unlikely hit) that became the band’s entire aesthetic in microcosm: It was difficult, it was silly, it made non-rock music feel extremely rock, it simultaneously poked fun at and embraced theatricality, and, above all, it was catchy enough to endure for generations. As their career progressed and their popularity soared, they perfected less complex styles, scoring their biggest hit with the indelible groove of 1980’s “Another One Bites the Dust.” (“We Are the Champions” and “We Will Rock You,” from 1977, will be around as long as sporting arenas of any kind exist.) Their success continued through the ’80s, even as Mercury was quietly living with AIDS. Queen’s breathtaking 1985 <i>Live Aid</i> performance at Wembley Stadium may be the pinnacle of their career (and is, in fact, the climax of their 2018 biopic, <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>), showing that for all their studio mastery and ingenuity, no one was better at commanding the attention of a couple hundred thousand people. After Mercury’s death in 1991, Queen occasionally carried on in various forms, with Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert taking turns in front for tours and new recordings, but those well-intentioned efforts largely proved just how irreplaceable Mercury was."

                "artistBio": "One of pop music’s most influential duos, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel parlayed a childhood friendship growing up in Queens, NY, into a tempestuous career that sprang from the folk revival but quickly reflected rock music’s rapidly expanding landscape during the second half of the '60s. While still in high school, the duo scored a minor hit as Tom & Jerry with “Hey Schoolgirl,” a bald homage to their vocal-harmony heroes, The Everly Brothers. They re-formed under their own names in 1963, inspired by the folk explosion, and then promptly disbanded following their first album, <I>Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.</I>. But after producer Tom Wilson added rock-band overdubs to “The Sounds of Silence”—without their knowledge—it became a massive hit and the title track to their eventual second album. The pair went on to make four studio albums between 1966 and 1970; their popularity climbed as they took control in the studio, kaleidoscopically expanding their vision with each recording. They masterfully echoed shifts in pop music, embracing the folk-rock sound of The Byrds and the baroque arrangements of The Beatles, while retaining their signature vocal harmonies, as Simon’s songs conveyed the era’s turmoil—whether personal journeys or anti-war sentiment—with literary concision. Those harmonious sounds notwithstanding, they ruptured soon after 1970’s <I>Bridge Over Troubled Water</I>, one of the best-selling albums in history at the time, spurred by the empathic, gospel-tinged title track (which quickly became a standard). Simon & Garfunkel sporadically reunited for concerts over the ensuing decades, including one in Central Park in 1981 that attracted a half-million listeners. Their sonic fingerprints live on, spanning ’60s peers like Crosby, Stills & Nash and 21st-century folk-rockers such as Fleet Foxes."

                "artistBio": "The history of popular music can essentially be divided into two eras: before and after Dylan. The Minnesotan raconteur born Robert Zimmerman didn’t just unleash rock ‘n’ roll’s latent social conscience and poetic potential, he ushered in the age of the artist as auteur—the idea that true art in music, particularly in the practice of album-making, comes from the personal expression of the artist himself. During the societal upheaval of the early ’60s, he emerged as an icon thanks to inspirational singalongs like “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “The Times They Are A-Changin’.” But since shocking his folky faithful by going electric in 1965—a transformation heralded by his seething signature track, “Like a Rolling Stone”—he’s constantly defied expectations by pursuing his every whim, laying out a road map to creative freedom that was immediately inherited by the likes of The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Neil Young. That non-conformist ethos has endured long past the ‘60s: Dig into “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” and you’ll find the seeds of punk’s sneering attitude, rap’s motor-mouthed repartee, and indie rock’s ramshackle DIY aesthetic. And yet Dylan is perpetually at the center of the conversation—an artist who's encompassed the entire American musical experience over his career, from folk and country to blues and gospel to jazz and rock—and one step removed from it. From the bad-romance wreckage of 1975’s <i>Blood on the Tracks</i> to the sobering meditations on mortality that permeate 1997’s <i>Time Out of Mind</i> to his 21st-century restorations of the Great American Songbook, he’s retained his uncanny ability to tap into the human condition while continuing to cultivate his singularly enigmatic aura."

                "artistBio": "As The Beatles’ resident court jester, Ringo Starr (born Richard Starkey, on July 7, 1940, in Liverpool, England) was initially known as much for his jokes as his drumming, shooting off one-liners to the press as effortlessly as he triggered the rapid-fire tom-tom rolls that open “She Loves You.” And his rare lead-vocal turns—whether the droll reading of Buck Owens’ country standard “Act Naturally” or the kid-friendly fantasia of “Yellow Submarine”—only amplified that playful personality. But as The Beatles transitioned from teen idols to experimental artists, Ringo’s backbeats formed the rock-solid foundation from which John Lennon leapt into psychedelic surrealism, Paul McCartney built his cinematic art-pop suites, and George Harrison explored Eastern mysticism. Whenever you hear a rock band described as “Beatlesque,” they’re often emulating one of Ringo’s bouncing-ball grooves; artists like the Beastie Boys and The Chemical Brothers retrofitted his most booming breaks for the rap/rave age. While Ringo may have continued to cultivate the image of jovial entertainer in his solo work, there’s still so much more complexity behind his humor. He uses it as a balm on the 1973 hard life lesson “It Don’t Come Easy,” which he cowrote with Harrison, and he gives voice to Lennon’s bitingly sardonic lyrics on “Goodnight Vienna” and “I’m the Greatest.”"

                  "standard": "The dissolution of The Beatles was a famously unpleasant situation: By 1968, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were sometimes working simultaneously in separate studios; only about half of the White Album’s songs featured the full band. Conceived by McCartney as an effort to reclaim the band’s marital groove, <i>Let It Be</i> presented The Beatles not as an elaborate studio art project but as four guys making music together in a room.<br />\nFor as divisive as Phil Spector’s 11th-hour contributions were (George Martin joked that he should be given a credit for production, while Spector should get one for overproduction), they were also overstated: Only a handful of tracks here—most notably Lennon’s “Across the Universe” and McCartney’s “The Long and Winding Road”—were all that heavily orchestrated. While some were chopped up and reassembled to get a better shape, the rest of the album (“Get Back”; George Harrison’s breezy “For You Blue”; the surrealistic blues of Lennon’s “Dig a Pony,” recorded live on the rooftop of the band’s Apple Corps offices) hewed more or less to what McCartney had envisioned: The Beatles rediscovering the poise and spontaneity of a great live band. (“Let It Be” was a relatively big production even before Spector came on board.)<br />\nStill, it’s a bittersweet, sometimes uncomfortable listen, and only further muddled by the eternal debate of whether or not it was actually the band’s last album, having been more or less finished before <i>Abbey Road</i> was started but not released until the band had broken up about a year later. (“And now we’d like to do ‘Hark, the Angels Come!’” Lennon squeaks in falsetto before “Let It Be”—a jab at what he felt was McCartney’s sodden pseudo-religiosity.) Still, listen and you can hear the heart, humor, and camaraderie that made them so unusual to begin with: McCartney’s “Two of Us,” the throwback “One After 909,” the eternal “Get Back.”<br />\nIn September 1969, Lennon quit. <i>Abbey Road</i> came out about a week later. McCartney effectively quit the following April, and put out his first solo record, <i>McCartney</i>, about a week later. In a self-interview that doubled as album promotion and carefully worded statement of personal independence, McCartney said that his only immediate plans were to grow up.",

                  "standard": "The dissolution of The Beatles was a famously unpleasant situation: By 1968, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were sometimes working simultaneously in separate studios; only about half of the White Album’s songs featured the full band. Conceived by McCartney as an effort to reclaim the band’s marital groove, <i>Let It Be</i> presented The Beatles not as an elaborate studio art project but as four guys making music together in a room.<br />\nFor as divisive as Phil Spector’s 11th-hour contributions were (George Martin joked that he should be given a credit for production, while Spector should get one for overproduction), they were also overstated: Only a handful of tracks here—most notably Lennon’s “Across the Universe” and McCartney’s “The Long and Winding Road”—were all that heavily orchestrated. While some were chopped up and reassembled to get a better shape, the rest of the album (“Get Back”; George Harrison’s breezy “For You Blue”; the surrealistic blues of Lennon’s “Dig a Pony,” recorded live on the rooftop of the band’s Apple Corps offices) hewed more or less to what McCartney had envisioned: The Beatles rediscovering the poise and spontaneity of a great live band. (“Let It Be” was a relatively big production even before Spector came on board.)<br />\nStill, it’s a bittersweet, sometimes uncomfortable listen, and only further muddled by the eternal debate of whether or not it was actually the band’s last album, having been more or less finished before <i>Abbey Road</i> was started but not released until the band had broken up about a year later. (“And now we’d like to do ‘Hark, the Angels Come!’” Lennon squeaks in falsetto before “Let It Be”—a jab at what he felt was McCartney’s sodden pseudo-religiosity.) Still, listen and you can hear the heart, humor, and camaraderie that made them so unusual to begin with: McCartney’s “Two of Us,” the throwback “One After 909,” the eternal “Get Back.”<br />\nIn September 1969, Lennon quit. <i>Abbey Road</i> came out about a week later. McCartney effectively quit the following April, and put out his first solo record, <i>McCartney</i>, about a week later. In a self-interview that doubled as album promotion and carefully worded statement of personal independence, McCartney said that his only immediate plans were to grow up.<br />\nThis Super Deluxe edition features an updated stereo mix of the album as well as a mix in Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos—engineered by Giles Martin—for a fully immersive listening experience. Additionally, there are previously unreleased takes (“Get Back,” “One After 909”) and Glyn Johns mixes (“I Me Mine” and “For You Blue”), a recording of “Don’t Let Me Down” from the band’s legendary 1969 rooftop concert on Savile Row, and more.",

                "editorialNotes": {
                  "standard": "“<i>Abbey Road</i> as a whole, as an album, is a very good gateway to the rest of the Beatles universe,” producer Giles Martin tells Apple Music. “Because it's the most contemporary-sounding album. It doesn't sound like it was recorded in the '60s.” What the album does sound like—and how it got to sound that way—is of particular interest to Martin, whose late father George was the Fab Four's original producer. And as he did with the 50th anniversary reissues of <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> in 2017 and the White Album in 2018, Martin has painstakingly rebuilt The Beatles' 11th and penultimate album piece by piece, and also unearthed a trove of demos and alternate tracks. (A highlight of the latter includes the band bantering about noise complaints from Abbey Road neighbors while recording “I Want You [She's So Heavy]”.)<br />\nThe goal of the project is not just to appeal to Beatles obsessives, but also to recontextualize what the album means for a contemporary audience and to upgrade the sonic fidelity to match what they are used to hearing. “One of the things we strive for in doing these mixes is so that when people listen to, say, Apple Music, you can have a playlist or a radio station with The Beatles next to Ed Sheeran. I'm interested in seeing if you can switch someone from hearing to listening; audiophiles listen to mixes and people listen to songs. I would love younger generations, or new listeners, or people who weren't aware, to go back and listen to The Beatles. They are the bedrock of popular music for so many people.” To help wade through the embarrassment of riches, Martin highlights a handful of tracks that best show The Beatles in this last unified moment before fracturing, and that are most revelatory in newly remixed form.<br />\n<b>Come Together</b>\n“One of the toughest songs to mix. The reason why is because it's so simple—there's not much on it. It's the band playing live, and it's one of their greatest performances. It's the one track that Ringo and Paul said to me, 'We were really good on this day.' It shows a sophistication as far as playing goes, how far The Beatles have come—they're basically taking what was originally a blues song and completely standing it on its head. The first thing we normally do when we remix Beatles stuff is we put the drums in the center. With 'Come Together,' we did that, and then it just didn't sound as good. So we actually took each individual drum hit and we panned the drums. They move from right to left, or right to center. On the original, they just stand in place.”<br />\n<b>Here Comes the Sun</b> \n“The biggest streaming Beatles song, the one that's the most listened to. It has a slightly more contemporary feel; it's acoustic. The one thing that the new mix of <i>Abbey Road</i> shows off is how good their backing vocals were.”<br />\n<b>I Want You (She’s So Heavy) [Trident Recording Session & Reduction Mix]</b>\n“There's so much written about how these records are created and what microphones they used and what my father's role was and what trousers people were wearing, et cetera. What excites me is when you hear someone talking and just being a guy in a studio making a piece of music that will last 50 years and beyond. What makes it great is the empathy that they have for the outside world: 'Okay, we'll do one more loud one and then we'll do one more'—and that was John Lennon, the angriest Beatle. That's why I do love the beauty of this: Great records are made by humans. They're not made by machine. The thing I look for in the demos is humanity—the creation and the sparks you hear that made the records you love.”<br />\n<b>Something (Studio Demo)</b>\n“Some demos are kind of strange. The thing about George is that there was a fragility to what he did. My dad would say that he never gave George enough time. He deserved more attention, and there is no doubt that George thought he deserved more attention as well. But George was considered a tapestry maker. He'd be in the corner with a needle and thread, working away on his music, and be very precise about things. And you get that from some demos.”<br />\n<b>The End</b>\n“The original is in mono—what we do is play the orchestra back in the studio and create a stereo sound piece. The guitar solos at the end are obviously Paul, John, and George, all playing on one track. We now separate them so you have them left-center-right, and that's probably how they were standing when they recorded them in the studio. Again, that's what I get back to: What we're trying to do is get closer to the performance. When anyone listens to <i>Abbey Road</i>, they should realize that they did play it live. They loved each other, and people can hear that now.”",

The album was a stark contrast to <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> in every aspect—from the cover art to the sounds within. The sheer breadth of material as well as the mixture of the loud and the soft is part of what makes \"The White Album\" so surprising. The heavy sounds of \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Yer Blues\" juxtapose with the gentle beauty of \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Julia.\" The cacophony of \"Revolution 9\" is followed by the orchestral lullaby of \"Good Night.\" The album's extended length gave the band room in which they could explore all of their musical influences and multiple forms of popular music, while creating revolutionary sounds in the studio.",

                  "standard": "Though wedged between the comparatively giant <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> and 1968’s White Album, <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> nevertheless played a part in The Beatles' story, and put a cap on a year in which the band made yet more music nobody was totally prepared for them to make. The album was released as a companion to a meandering, band-directed movie, and its first half is probably one of the lowest-stakes sides in the band’s catalog—a relief, in a way, from how high-stakes their music had become. Still, this was The Beatles in 1967—momentum was strong. What had started out as a string of acid playground rhymes turned into Lennon’s angriest song this side of 1970 (“I Am the Walrus”), while McCartney’s simple sentimentality had taken on a quality that felt stoic, almost abstract (“The Fool on the Hill”). There was a rare instrumental (“Flying”), a foggy Harrison drone (“Blue Jay Way”), and an invocation of the past by McCartney that blurred lines between sweet and eerie (“Your Mother Should Know”).<br />\nWhile the band had helped rechristen the album format as an artistic statement unto itself, they were still releasing singles—as in tracks that weren’t associated with any album. Designed primarily as a consumer service, the second half of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> collected what they’d offered in 1967. The yin-yang of McCartney’s “Penny Lane” and Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever” (originally released on the same 7-inch record) arguably says more about what ground the band covered in seven minutes than any other two songs in their catalog—the former baroque, charming, and upbeat; the latter dense and melancholy—variations on a theme of seemingly simple pasts refracted, dreamlike, through the present. And if “I Am the Walrus” was Lennon’s dark foray into contradiction and surreality, McCartney’s “Hello, Goodbye” was its bright counterpart. “Baby, You’re a Rich Man” probably doesn’t get the credit it deserves. “All You Need Is Love,” debuted to an estimated 400 million people in the world’s first live international satellite TV production (<i>Our World</i>), did receive wide acclaim, and while cynicism and embarrassment about 1967’s Summer of Love would set in as soon as a few years later, it probably deserves more.<br />\nAs for the movie that gave the album its name, press coverage of it was so uniformly hostile (not to mention viewer feedback to the BBC switchboard so sustained) that McCartney went on the BBC the day after it first aired to defuse the tension. Asked why he thought people didn’t like it, McCartney said he wasn’t sure—he liked it fine.",

                  "standard": "For better and worse, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> helped set the precedent that rock bands could (and should) do more or less whatever they wanted. Songs got longer, albums grew concepts, and the idea of the LP as a concise product meant to showcase a performer’s talents gave way to the suspicion that commercial concerns ultimately only served The Man. A few months before The Beatles were set to record <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>, Bob Dylan had released <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>, an album so expansive it had to literally be pressed onto two records, while The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i> stretched the dimensions and possibilities of the three-minute pop song. McCartney in particular had been fascinated by things like Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention’s 1966 debut, <i>Freak Out!</i>, a double album whose hodgepodge of songs, noise, skits, and sound gags mirrored conceptual art’s breaking of the painterly frame. Where The Beatles had once sought to distill and consolidate, now they were looking to expand. McCartney had even come up with an alter ego and pseudo-unifying backstory—a move Lennon later said only worked because the band <i>said</i> it worked. In other words, they didn’t want to just exorcise the group that made “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” they wanted to smother them with a pillow. Vacationing in France just before recording had started, McCartney slicked his hair back with Vaseline and wandered the streets in a fake mustache and clear-lens glasses, an experience he called “quite liberating.”<br />\nFor all its experiments (“A Day in the Life”) and invocations of the counterculture (“Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds”), it’s probably the band’s most conservative album: the beer hall sing-alongs of the title track and “With a Little Help From My Friends,” the old-timey entertainments of “Being for the Benefit of Mister Kite!,” the domestic contentment of “When I’m Sixty-Four.” Like The Kinks circa “Waterloo Sunset” and <i>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</i> and The Beach Boys of <i>Smiley Smile</i>, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> is an album that looked toward the past instead of the future, the work of guys in their late twenties starting to wonder if they’d been too eager to break from the old world—or at least might have lost something along the way. (Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever,” recorded around the same time, covered similar themes; that the band was all taking acid—a drug that has a way of flattening geologic time—probably didn’t hurt either.) Even Lennon’s lyric on “A Day in the Life”—“I read the news today, oh boy”—rang with a cosmic quaintness, an image not of young radicals on the loose but of the aging souls of “Eleanor Rigby,” finding infinite richness in a narrow life. A couple of months after the album was released, the band—along with partners, children, and business infrastructure—traveled to Greece with the vague intention of buying an island for everyone to live on, but eventually managed to think better of it.",

                "editorialNotes": {
                  "standard": "One of the great, possibly true stories about 1966’s <i>Revolver</i> concerns an exchange between Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan at London’s Mayfair Hotel about what they were currently working on. (In Dylan’s case, it was <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>.) On hearing the tape loops and death poetry of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” Dylan allegedly said to McCartney, “Oh, I get it. You don’t want to be cute anymore.” \n\nIt’s not entirely true. Part of what makes <i>Revolver</i> appealing is that it’s as much “Yellow Submarine” and the domestic sweetness of “Here, There and Everywhere” as it is “She Said She Said” and “Tomorrow Never Knows.” But Dylan’s point was well-taken: For a band that put out “I Want to Hold Your Hand” less than three years earlier, the relative complexity of <i>Revolver</i>—in both sound and subject matter—not only challenged The Beatles’ image as the pop band the whole family could agree on (as opposed to, say, The Rolling Stones), but it also put pop on a course toward unfamiliar horizons.\n\nNot only were The Beatles able to bridge their interest in the relatively uncommercial worlds of psychedelia, experimental, and Indian classical music with Motown (“Got to Get You Into My Life”) and what we now think of as classically Beatlesque pop (“Good Day Sunshine”), but they also gave us a template for the pop album as the kaleidoscopically varied studio construction we think of it as today. Cute, but more. \n\nOn the occasion of the album’s 2022 Super Deluxe reissue—which, in addition to a new mix in Spatial Audio by Giles Martin and Sam Okell, features some extraordinary rehearsals, outtakes, and demos—we’re taking a look back at what shaped <i>Revolver</i> and what <i>Revolver</i> shaped in turn.\n\n<b>Before: The R&B Backbeat</b>\n<i>Revolver</i> is the last Beatles album where you can really hear the influence of American soul and R&B. “Taxman” is obvious, as is “Got to Get You Into My Life,” which John called “our Tamla-Motown bit.” But you can also hear it in “And Your Bird Can Sing” and “Love You To,” whose Indian influence is anchored by a beat heavy enough to drive a dance floor regardless of the continent it’s on. And where the beat of “Tomorrow Never Knows” is rightly cited as a precursor to techno and drum ’n’ bass, it’s also a take on the syncopations of James Brown drummer Clyde Stubblefield, who said he got his style, in part, from listening to washing machines and trains—the funk of daily life. Their growing conceptual interests didn’t get in the way of their roots as a bar-and-dance band, and their ability to bridge the two—or, more importantly, to dissolve the distinction between them—is part of what makes <i>Revolver</i> <i>Revolver</i>. Four people, one room.\n\n<b>Before: British Humor and the Surrealism of Daily Life</b>\nFor however mystical <i>Revolver</i> can seem, squint and you hear an album mostly about ordinary life. “Eleanor Rigby,” “Doctor Robert,” the “Taxman,” the lovebirds of “Here, There and Everywhere,” and the eccentric of “I’m Only Sleeping”: these are the people in your neighborhood, and if they’re stranger than you remember, it might be because you never really looked. The Kinks were experts in this field. And John, in particular, was a fan of the Scottish singer Ivor Cutler, whose novelty songs masked a sense of surrealism that pointed toward more cosmic realms. The point isn’t just that <i>Revolver</i> was strange, but that it located its strangeness in places easily dismissed as familiar. So, while John borrowed the first line of “Tomorrow Never Knows” from a book connecting LSD with <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, its title came from a more historically modest source: Ringo Starr.\n\n<b>Before: Power of the Experiment</b>\nGiven their cultural stature, it’s easy to forget that The Beatles didn’t really know what they were doing at the time. So, while <i>Revolver</i>’s experimental qualities—the tape loops of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” the dislocated horn sections of “Got to Get You Into My Life”—could seem pretentious or alienating, they’re better understood as an embrace of the same unknowns that led to “Yesterday” or “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).” Namely, can this be done? Though the band’s interest in avant-garde composers like John Cage or Luciano Berio wasn’t always obvious in their sound, it spoke to a sense of experimentation and open-mindedness that spurred them on when they could’ve easily and comfortably stayed in the same place.\n\n<b>Before: Pop as Art</b>\nPart of The Beatles’ story is that of pop’s transformation into something like art. Not that <i>Revolver</i> was without precedent. Frank Sinatra’s serial-like string of albums in the ’50s (<i>In the Wee Small Hours</i>, <i>Only the Lonely</i>, <i>No One Cares</i>), Ray Charles’ <i>Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music</i>, the sound sculptures of producers like Phil Spector and Joe Meek, the arrangements of The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i>—all undoubtedly pop music. But they’re also examples of artists stretching pop to accommodate a sense of depth and conceptual ambition that hadn’t been there before. As George said around the time of <i>Revolver</i>’s release, selling a lot of records was nice. Now the point was to make them better.\n\n<b>After: Psychedelia for the Mainstream</b>\nThe real psychedelic quality of <i>Revolver</i> wasn’t its sound but its subject. Time, memory, the inevitability of death: With the exception of Bob Dylan and The Byrds, no mid-’60s pop artists were wading as deeply into inner space as The Beatles. And because, in George’s words, they’d “had a few hits,” their ideas landed on audiences that probably wouldn’t have encountered them otherwise, or at least ones that might’ve been more hesitant to hear them out. The effect was to expand our sense of the terrain that pop music could cover and introduce a sense of headiness and ambiguity that gave way to everything from Jimi Hendrix and Prince to the inward-facing stance of alternative rock. <i>Revolver</i> tried to touch what can’t be touched.\n\n<b>After: The Studio as Instrument</b>\nBefore <i>Revolver</i>, the studio was, by and large, a place where bands went to record music they’d already worked out. After <i>Revolver</i>, it became a kind of instrument of its own. It wasn’t just the unprecedented amount of time The Beatles spent making it (220 hours to <i>Rubber Soul</i>’s 80) or their experiments with new technology; it was the way they opened their process to the concept of music being less a set of notes than a sequence of sounds—an attitude that evolved into everything from dub to shoegaze to hip-hop. Paul remembers meeting with producer George Martin before they went into the studio to play him what they’d been writing. When they got to “Tomorrow Never Knows,” Martin was curious but puzzled: there were no chord changes, no verses, no chorus. In other words, it wasn’t a song. The blueprint was in the band’s collective head, but you couldn’t make sense of it until the work was done.\n\n<b>After: Pop as Playground</b>\n<i>Revolver</i> helped define the pop album as a loose, collagelike space where you could get any number of sounds and moods thrown at you. Paul’s sweetness, John’s cynicism, the experimental and the straightforward, Western R&B and Eastern classical—and each of them somehow as much a part of the band’s identity as the others. Not only was the shift an important step toward understanding artists as people who curate and arrange the world rather than creating it out of thin air, but it also gave us a template you can still hear in everything from <i>Thriller</i> to <i>Purple Rain</i>, M.I.A.’s <i>Kala</i>, and Frank Ocean’s <i>Blonde</i>. <i>Revolver</i> wasn’t just a marketing tool; it was an experience. And the band’s eclecticism wasn’t a lack of commitment—it was liberation.\n",

                  "standard": "It wasn’t just that <i>Rubber Soul</i> was sonically groundbreaking (it was), or that Lennon and McCartney’s songwriting had reached new heights of maturity and ambiguity (okay), but that it was the first Beatles album where each song seemed to exist unto itself and yet worked in alchemical harmony with everything around it: the emergence of the pop album as creative kaleidoscope.<br />\nMcCartney had told the <i>New Musical Express</i> that the band was banking on comedy being the next big thing after protest music—a reflection, possibly, of the existential irreverence one feels on acid, their growing insularity from (and reluctance toward) the culture at large, a philosophical commitment to enjoying the ride, or some giddy mix of all three.<br />\nWhatever the case, <i>Rubber Soul</i> is a deeply funny album: the gender play of “Drive My Car” (and the <i>beep-beep</i> backing vocals), the cabaret of “Michelle” (because nothing warms up the object of one’s desire like French), the way Lennon sucks deeply through his teeth before oozing the chorus to “Girl.” Even the album’s most earnest songs (“Nowhere Man,” “In My Life”) were touched by a nursery-rhyme gentleness that made their themes (psychic alienation, the astonishing continuity of past and present) go down easily. As for “Norwegian Wood,” what can you really do with the suggestion that the narrator burns the girl’s house down but shrug in uncertainty? This is how the album unfolds: colorful, dreamy, and delirious on the surface, with shadows swimming underneath.<br />\nThe overall feeling is one of liberation: In getting a little chemical-assisted distance from their egos, the band was able to explore style in ways that felt fluid and radical, changing costumes from song to song instead of locking themselves continuously into being The Beatles—a channel-changing approach that only became more pronounced as their career wound on (especially on the White Album and <i>Abbey Road</i>), not to mention set a new precedent for the diversity of modes and expressions pop artists were suddenly allowed to explore. As for the title, McCartney had remembered something an old bluesman said about Mick Jagger—that he was “plastic soul.” In the original iteration, it was a diss; in The Beatles’ version, it was a statement of liberation: In embracing artifice, you free yourself from the confines of the real.",

Shortly after the group's lineup solidified in 1961, a series of wildly successful singles made them superstars, and in the mid-'60s Beatlemania swept the globe. The rest of the decade was defined by fearless experimentation, musical reinvention, and visionary recordings. Years after their 1970 breakup, The Beatles continue to be a keystone influence on countless artists. This selection of unforgettable songs—now highlighting some of the most revelatory tracks from the new super deluxe White Album collection—offers an introduction to the band's towering legacy for new listeners, and an opportunity for longtime fans to fall in love with them all over again.",

Shortly after the group's lineup solidified in 1961, a series of wildly successful singles made them superstars, and in the mid-'60s Beatlemania swept the globe. The rest of the decade was defined by fearless experimentation, musical reinvention, and visionary recordings. Years after their 1970 breakup, The Beatles continue to be a keystone influence on countless artists. This selection of unforgettable songs—now highlighting some of the most revelatory tracks from the new super deluxe White Album collection—offers an introduction to the band's towering legacy for new listeners, and an opportunity for longtime fans to fall in love with them all over again.",

Enter The Beatles: always there, always great. “The Beatles are true British icons and musical innovators, and I love how they used their art as a medium to express their progressive thinking,” says Jessica Skye, Apple Fitness+ trainer for Yoga, Mindful Cooldown, and Meditation. “Their music feels like a fusion of rock with rhythm and groovy blues, and their songs add such an uplifting and fun energy to any workout.” So whether you’re doing something high-impact or getting bi’s with a little help from your friends (sorry), try this mix of Beatles tracks compiled by our Apple Music editors and Fitness+ trainers—together, we can work it out. We switch things up here regularly, so if you hear a track you like, add it to your library.",

Enter The Beatles: always there, always great. “The Beatles are true British icons and musical innovators, and I love how they used their art as a medium to express their progressive thinking,” says Jessica Skye, Apple Fitness+ trainer for Yoga, Mindful Cooldown, and Meditation. “Their music feels like a fusion of rock with rhythm and groovy blues, and their songs add such an uplifting and fun energy to any workout.” So whether you’re doing something high-impact or getting bi’s with a little help from your friends (sorry), try this mix of Beatles tracks compiled by our Apple Music editors and Fitness+ trainers—together, we can work it out. We switch things up here regularly, so if you hear a track you like, add it to your library.",
